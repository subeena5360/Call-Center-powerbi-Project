The goal of this project is to design and develop an interactive dashboard for monitoring and improving the performance of a call center. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) that help assess the efficiency and effectiveness of call center operations. It also includes visualizations to track call volumes, durations, and reasons, providing valuable information for resource allocation and process optimization.


This project highlights the importance of monitoring key performance indicators in call center operations. The interactive dashboards provide valuable insights into performance trends, enabling data-driven decisions that improve resource allocation, customer satisfaction, and overall efficiency.
